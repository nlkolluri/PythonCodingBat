# PythonCodingBat
Solutions to all of the codingbat problems in python -- my work at/toward learning a new language.
If a solution was provided online and matched my code (and it was feasibly possible to do so without much loss of efficiency), I changed the way I solved the problem so that it differed from their solution.
